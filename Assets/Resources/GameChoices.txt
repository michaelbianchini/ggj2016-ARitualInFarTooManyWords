[FarmerAtTournament]
You have been taken to the Tournament by your parents to see the knights perform in the Joust and the Sword. Your father tells you how the knights participate in these events to hone their skills and to earn fame and glory.
<> I say “when I grow up I want to be a just like those Knights!” [Squire]
<> I say “Father, please take me home the swords are loud and I’m scared.” [Farmer]
<> I say “Mother, take me to see the funny glass the man over there is making” [Craftsman]
;


[OrphanAtTournament]
To make some coin you have taken a job mucking out the horse stalls at the tournament. It is gross and difficult work but it keeps you out of trouble, or at least that’s what the city guardsman who sent you here said.
<> I make the best of the job given to me and as I am working a knight is watching me from across the stable yard. [Squire]
<> I say “forget this” and decide to walk around the tournament when I bump into an Old Gypsy Woman. [Craftsman]
<> I decided I would rather die than do this nasty work anymore and kick the guard in the shin before I run down an alley to get away from everyone and everything. [Destitute]
 ;


[GypsyAtTournament]
You have been learning to make the stained glass windows the same way your father made them which is the same way you grandfather made them, etc. This has taught you to appreciate the art in things but yet you wonder what other things life could bring to you.
<>While I was working with my father I see that a man with his wife and son have come to see the glass. They have dirt on their hands and smell of manure but are kind and even though I knew they could not afford the stained glass I give the woman a small glass window hanging anyway. [Farmer]
<> I ask my grandmother for advice on why she chose to travel and make stained glass instead of settling down somewhere. Her answer is because the only way to make their glass the best, was to see the beauty of the whole world from the smallest flower to the biggest mountain. [Craftsman]
<> I ask my father for a little spending money and permission to take a break and go watch the tournament for a while. He says ok, and as I am coming around to the side of the sword fighting ring I am approached by a young nobleman who asks me to place a bet. [Destitute]
;


[NobleAtTournament]
You have been sitting on the cushions your manservant has laid down for you to watch the Tournament from, in the Nobles box. You are enjoying yourself but have decided to go for a walk around the Tournament grounds.
<> I order a knight that I am not familiar with to tell me about his adventures. He tells me that if I expect him to have a civilized discussion with me, that I would do well to stop demanding things of him. I am taken aback but instantly am in love with the idea that I can find out more information if I follow this man and his rules. [Squire]
<> I am walking around near the Sword arena when a wealthy gypsy boy crosses my path. I decide to ask him if he wants to wager on the current match. [Destitute]

[Craftsman]
At the Tournament you fall in love with the idea of making something you are passionate about and selling it around the world. The Gypsy’s have their stained glass but it doesn’t feel like that is something you would like. You look to find what you’re passionate about…
<> I have seen many items that people have made to sell, but the one thing I don’t see are toys for children. If I make something that bring joy to children I think my craftsmanship will be we rewarded. [Toymaker1Exp]
<> I see one thing that all the knights at the tournament did, which was carry a ton of equipment in a cart with them. If I learn the blacksmithing trade maybe I can make a way to travel to each tournament and act as an on-site blacksmith. [Blacksmith1Exp]
<> I don’t seem to be good with making things by hand but I love to make people laugh or cry with a flick of my tongue. I have decided to follow a new playwright by the name of Rattlespike and act in his plays. [Actor1Exp]

[Toymaker1Exp] {TM}
You have learned the basics of carving wood and now you are able to make recognizable trinkets that will interest children.

[Toymaker2] {TMGirl}
It is so sad to watch the exchange between the mother and her daughter...
<> I have had a very lucrative week so I pull the mother aside and tell her to choose any doll her daughter wants, on the house. [Toymaker2Exp]
<> I apologize I cannot offer the girl the doll she likes, however I follow the family home and leave the doll on the stoop, from an “Anonymous Friend”. [Toymaker2Exp]
<> I determine that the materials I use for my dolls is too hard to come by, which is the reason why my prices are so high, I will need to be change out this type of wood for a more easily found material so next time the girls mother will be able to get a doll. [Toymaker2Exp]

[Toymaker2Exp]
Your craft brings you a lot of joy so you have decided to have a bit of fun. As you close shop for the day you decide to go to the local pub.

[BlacksmithRandomOption] 
You have yet to find a way to make swords or armor for knights on the go and this now leaves you stuck in a town that only has a tournament once every other year. 
<> I push to find a way to make my metals stronger but lighter to make them more portable. [Blacksmith2Exp]
<> I discover a way to build a cart that can house my hammer and anvil without requiring any unloading which leaves the only thing to build, at each site, my furnace.  [Blacksmith2Exp]

[Blacksmith2Exp]
While traveling between tournament locations you have found a vein of metal ore that you have never seen before. You call this new metal ifoundium.

As you think back to the winged shadow, it dawns on you that your field has been bombarded by the excrement of a dragon. As you wipe at the caustic muck that now cakes your hair, you begin to catch your breath and take stock of the situation, formulating a plan of how you will handle this boulder that now looms above the tops of your rows of corn.
<> I spread the material across my land. [FarmerManure1]
<> I roll the mound down to the river to let it disperse downstream. [FarmerPollution1]
<> I seek the village elders for their advice. [FarmerTreasure1]

[FarmerManure1]
You see this occurrence as a blessing in disguise and gather your boys, setting to work shoveling the dark material into a cart. You trust that this rare natural dung is filled with nourishment that will fortify your crops and bring you a bountiful harvest. With your cart you are able to bring it to the farthest reaches of your land. It takes you and your boys several days, but at last, the oozing boulder has been diminished and your land fertilized.

[FarmerManure2]
As the weeks go by, a chilling realization becomes undeniable. Contrary to your expectations, the dragon manure has had a devastating effect on every one of your fields. Leaves turned red, then brown and curled to dust. Formerly healthy growths fell to the earth and shed their skins. Even your livestock have begun to look sickly. By the time these effects were seen, it was far too late to reverse the effects. You and your family take inventory of what little food stocks remain in storage.

You gather your boys and your oxen, together rolling the boulder of dung down to the nearby river’s edge. You ford your way to the middle of the river and as the water softens the reeking black mass, you shovel it into the current to be taken away. This goes on well after dark, but at last you have reduced the mound to a memory.

[FarmerTreasure1]
The fallen mound of muck has left you jarred and disoriented. You cannot fathom the implications of what has happened, and after consulting with your wife, you decide to seek advice from the village elders. You set out the next morning, making your way down the long road toward town. As you near, you notice several pillars of billowing smoke rising from one of the town districts. However, your destination does not bring you close enough to find the sources, heading instead toward a stone lodge on the edge of town.

[FarmerTreasure2]
After explaining what has befallen your farm to the room full of old, leathery men and women, they retreat to an inner chamber to confer privately amongst themselves. When at last they return to the audience room, the eldest man steps forward and speaks to you of a rare and valued mushroom that only grows on the caustic excrement of a fire-breathing dragon. This mushroom is said to be used for numerous purposes, including powerful healing potions and poultices, adhesive, and has even been used as a secret ingredient in a strong brew of stout. He entreats you to keep the dung in a dark and isolated environment, far from any sources of food or water.

Months go by, and the desolation of farmland has not stopped at the borders of your property. Winds and rain have apparently taken the poison and spread it across the surrounding countryside, resulting in what has become a serious famine. One day, the local militia come to visit your farmstead, explaining that a state of emergency has been declared and that by martial order you are to yield up all food stores that remain.
<> I lie, telling them that I have no food to spare. [FarmerFamineDenial1]
<> I offer up most of my food stores, saving a small portion for my own family. [FarmerFamineYield1]
<> I tell the militia that I will not give up my supplies without a fight. [FarmerFamineDefend1]

[FarmerFamineDenial1] {infamous}
You state that there is nothing left for you to offer up, claiming that the famine has hit your farm worst of all and at a time when you had your lowest food stocks of the year. The militia leader looks out amongst your dry withered fields and nods somberly, acknowledging what he had suspected from his first approach. He thanks you for  your assistance and departs.

[FarmerFamineDenial2]
After several weeks, your neighbors and the nearby village being to struggle with malnutrition, and deaths have begun to occur. A band of bandits known to reside in the area has become increasingly strong and disruptive of late, using the famine as an opportunity to gain wealth and power through black market dealing in foodstuffs. The militia make an effort to stop this from occurring, but in their own weakened state of health they are swiftly defeated, leaving the town undefended and at the mercy of the bandit group.

After several weeks, and after having consumed most of the food that you set aside, your eldest son takes ill. Despite your best efforts, his body being weakened by malnutrition has left him vulnerable, and it is not long before he passes away. Together, your family mourns his loss, but deep in your heart you are tormented by the thought that his death was ultimately brought on by your own failures of judgement.

[FarmerPlague1]
Weeks go by, and word has spread of a cruel, highly contagious plague that has been spreading within the nearby village and the surrounding farmsteads. One day, a frail looking man is seen at the outskirts of your property, yelling for your attention. You approach cautiously, and see that this man displays the telltale signs of plague, including heavy bruising, and boils. He calls to you, pleading for your help.
<> I tell him to be gone, and swear to end his life if he strays onto my property. [FarmerPlagueBanish1]

You know in your heart that this man is lost and have heard the stories of the agonizing experience of death by this plague. You grab your pitchfork and approach the man cautiously, as he shambles forward toward you.

Nonetheless, the plague does eventually run its course and in time, things return to normal.

You feel a strange sense of responsibility for this man, taking mercy on his plight.

One evening, you hear a scream from out by the barn and you rush out to investigate. Your eldest son is rushing towards you from the structure, and you can see by the moonlight that he appears to be covered in what looks like blood. Apparently, your son had gone out to investigate the barn’s noises, and found the man. They had spoken for a while, but then suddenly the plagued man paused before retching up blood that splashed all over your boy.

It is devastating, but within days it becomes clear that your son has contracted the plague as well.

Rumor has reached a local band of bandits that you have come into possession of a rare and valuable artifact, useful in the crafting of a potent mind-altering alcoholic beverage. One day, as you are out in the fields, a group of bandits descends upon you, demanding that you yield to them your mushrooms and food stores. However, it is clear that they do not in fact know where your mushrooms may be, nor exactly how they are grown.

You don’t believe that defying these bandits could end well.

As you consider your options, you believe that giving in to the bandit demands unconditionally would only lead to a lifetime of subordination to them.

Rather than giving them away, you negotiate a trade deal with the bandits, whereby they will purchase from you monthly for a handsome sum.

You make out quite well with the the deal, earning a supplemental income on top of your successful farm. The bandits have used the mushrooms you provide to brew a potent variety of stout ale that has mind-altering effects. Taverns and pubs in the nearby villages have started to resemble opium dens, with bar fights becoming commonplace and patrons remaining in a drunken stupor for days on end. Rumors have spread that you are the supplier of the ale’s mysterious ingredient, and for those not yet in the clutches of the brew, you have acquired an air of infamy.

The boy leads you through the village, towards the river past most of the main buildings. As you get closer to the river, the sounds of children playing in water get louder. The boy leads you directly to two children, who must be no older than 7 or 8. You ask them where they’re from, and they point in a direction towards the East.

However, after a moment's thought, you realize the closest town in that direction is easily 15 or 16 miles. They explain that their father left them at the edge of this village while he was on a journey to the capital. They tell you he said it would be a short journey, that he needed to pick up some much needed supplies for his village. The children were told to stay with some relatives here. However, as you talk to them more, you realize the relatives were killed in the recent dragon attack.

They don’t seem very fazed by that realization though, since they have clearly never even met them. You take them into the village to decide what to do with them.

After deliberating with the villagers, you realize it could be quite some time before their father returns. However, there is little to be done, so now it’s just a matter of what to do with them.
<>I train them in swordplay, they should know how to defend themselves. [SquirePlagueEventKniggitDeadSwords]

[SquirePlagueEventKniggitDeadSwords]
The children gladly spar with you with wooden swords. However, it’s fairly obvious it’s more of a game to them. Every few minutes ends in a wrestling match when they realize they aren’t going to win. You spend the time after meals and rebuilding the town teaching these children, hoping your efforts could make their lives just a tiny bit easier. Battered and bruised, you feel you are going to make a difference.

Every day the children meet you first thing in the morning. They just helped you carry supplies. The next day, they helped you rebuild one of the neighbors floors. After a week, they were helping the other villagers with little instruction on their own. It was clear to you they were mature for their age. Each day ends with tired aching muscles and a few new bruises, but you think that these new skills could really make a difference.

“Please sir knight, please wake up!” a shrill young voice screams, jostling you awake. You see the younger of the siblings, desperately grasping at the side of your bed. You are led to the building where the two children have been staying.

“Please, I can’t wake my brother up, do something.” She begs. As you inspect the brother, you notice he has a fairly significant amount of bruising from working.

CRASH! A small bowl was dropped behind you. The owner of the house, bringing you water to clean the boys face, has her mouth agape in horror. The grim and eerie silence have the hair on the back of your neck standing on edge. Suddenly, tears start to well up in her now ashen face.

When were they affected? How long has everyone been exposed? What do we do now? Questions race through your head. K’niggit would have an answer right now. The color begins to drain from your face. A man enters the room. He gently holds the woman from behind, stroking her dark auburn hair. As he hears her whisper to herself, you also see a somber look cross his eyes.

His face warps into a morbid expression as he explains the boys state to you. The plague is curable, but only if caught early. The large amount of bruises on the boy indicate he’s reached a point of no return, in addition to exposing everyone in the town for at least a few days. He immediately quarantines the boy and sister in the bedroom they were sleeping in. He claims there is little hope for either of the siblings, and there’s a good chance many of the townspeople could have been afflicted. He sends his wife to talk to one of the local militia, explaining that if they get the medicine quickly, there’s a chance the village could end this before it begins. You go to bed, praying the village will be able to pull through.

You wake with a start. Sweat drenches your blanket, it sticks to the skin on your chest. You roll towards the edge of the bed. As you turn to sit up, a wave of nausea sweeps over you. You moan and realize without a doubt, you were exposed enough to catch the same sickness as the young boy. Later that evening, the man from earlier brings you a hot drink. It smells of tar and faintly of bread. It tastes similarly.

While walking with the children, you run into Sir K’niggit and ask for his advice. As you are discussing several options, K’niggit suddenly turns his head and begins to sniff the air around him. He urgently moves closer to the children, sniffing with each step he takes. He suddenly spins around, a serious look spreads across his face. “These children have been exposed to the plague.” he rapidly explains. He elaborates “the sulfurous odor around them indicates it, but it seems to me they’re in the very early stages.” He pushes the children towards a carriage near the town center.

One healer mentions an old woman who lives in the woods, a few miles from town. She is said to be very knowledgable, but cynical too, and would require a large payment.

You know that this is a very dangerous mission and think of your Love one last time. As you enter the dark side of the moon your Tremor makes ripples through the galaxy and produces sounds like cracking ice. You wonder if you made the right choice. Should you go back and land on the moon and go back to Earth or stay in the air in search of the comet?

As you begin to move towards the surface of the dark side of the moon, you feel the gravitational waves pull your Tremor towards the moon. You are preparing to enter the moon’s atmosphere to land when out of nowhere the Great Comet appears, and its tail pulls you back into space. Do you try to take a ride on the Great Comet’s Tail or continue trying to land on the surface of the dark side of the moon?

After the ice waves of the comet pass the only sound you can hear is the twinkling of stars. You feel yourself drifting. Your Tremor is not working. Slowly you realize you are being sucked into the gravitational waves of a black hole.

Do you continue surfing on the tail of the Great Comet or do you get off and fight the Space Dragon?
